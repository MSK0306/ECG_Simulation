# ECG_Simulation
A Simulation Framework for Modeling Cardiac Electrophysiology and 12-Lead ECG Generation

This is a supplementary repository for the following thesis study:

Exploring Key Considerations and Challenges in Developing a Simulation Framework for Modeling Cardiac Electrophysiology and 12-Lead ECG Generation

[openCARP](https://opencarp.org/), an open cardiac electrophysiology simulator, is used for the implementation of the framework. The data is obtained from a publicly available virtual cohort of four-chamber heart meshes in the following [link](https://zenodo.org/records/3890034). Docker containers in a Linux-based operating system are utilized for the simulations.
